# Project Structure Documentation Maintenance Rule

**Core Guideline:** The project structure overview MUST be kept up-to-date.

**Trigger for Update:**

Whenever significant changes are made to the project's directory or key file structure, the documentation file **MUST** be updated accordingly.

Significant changes include (but are not limited to):

*   Adding or removing a Django app (`apps/...`).
*   Adding or removing major top-level directories (`static`, `templates`, etc.).
*   Significantly reorganizing static asset subdirectories (`static/css`, `static/js`).
*   Significantly reorganizing template subdirectories (`templates/partials`, `templates/<app>/partials`).
*   Adding or removing key configuration files at the root or in `config/`.
*   Adding or removing other major functional directories.

**File to Update:**

*   @file:memory-bank/project_structure.md

**Procedure:**

1.  After making structural changes, use `list_dir` or manual inspection to confirm the new layout.
2.  Edit `@file:memory-bank/project_structure.md` to accurately reflect the new structure and purpose of added/modified/removed items.
3.  Ensure the commit containing the structural code changes also includes the update to `project_structure.md`.
