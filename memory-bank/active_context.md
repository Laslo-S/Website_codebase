# Active Context

## Detailed State

**Project Status:** Active Development

**Current Focus:** Documenting the refined custom JS gallery (`css_gallery_init.js`):
    - **Mechanism:** Uses `transform: translateX` updated within `requestAnimationFrame`.
    - **Features:** Seamless looping (JS modulo logic), CSS variable control (appearance, physics, sizing), dynamic aspect ratio adjustment, reliable idle scroll (direct `translateX` update), interactive mouse control (physics simulation).
    - **Files Updated:** `css_gallery_init.js`, `base.html` (variables), `home.html` (classes), `input.css` (styles).

**Next Step:** Update `system_patterns.md`, `.cursor/rules/frontend/04_styling_layout.mdc`, and `README.md`.

**Recent Milestones:**
- Completed Phase 17: Interactive Gallery Refinement.
- Debugged and resolved issues with low-speed idle scroll stalling.
- Debugged and resolved 404 errors related to previous gallery implementation.
- Completed dynamic gallery system overhaul.
- Completed services section background animation implementation.
- Completed Lottie element fixes and refinements.
- Completed Phase 16: Integrated dynamic data for homepage gallery (via new `SlideshowImage` model) and news section. Updated static links (Client Portal login).
- Completed Refactoring: Moved interactive background JS to `static/js/` and Hero showcase HTML to `templates/partials/`.
- Completed Phase 15: Styled all homepage sections (`home.html`) based on v0 design, including interactive background and reusable partials.
- Completed Phase 14: Translated base HTML structure (base.html, header/footer partials, homepage sections) from v0 source files. Integrated global CSS variables and base styles from v0 into Tailwind configuration (input.css, tailwind.config.js).
- Completed Phase 13: Added status fields, implemented comprehensive preview mode (admin toggle, frontend banner, content filtering), simplified client deliverable workflow, refined admin UI.
- Debugged and resolved issues with URL routing, model imports, middleware logic, template context, and CSS styling related to the preview system.
