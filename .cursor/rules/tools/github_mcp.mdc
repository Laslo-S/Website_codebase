# GitHub MCP Usage Rules

This rule governs the use of the GitHub MCP server (`@modelcontextprotocol/server-github`), configured in @file:.cursor/mcp.json.

**Core Guidelines:**

1.  **Read Operations:** Use for read-only operations (e.g., `git status`, list branches, view history) when requested to understand repository state.
2.  **Write Operations:** Use for write operations (e.g., commit, push, create branch/PR) **ONLY** when explicitly instructed and after user confirmation of the exact action.
3.  **Commit Message Approval:** Before using the MCP to commit changes, always present the generated commit message (following Conventional Commits format) to the user for approval.
4.  **Token Requirement:** Remind the user that a `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable (Personal Access Token with repo scope) is required in the `.env` file for write operations and potentially for accessing private repositories.
