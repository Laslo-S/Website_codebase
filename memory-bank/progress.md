### Phase 10: Implement API for External AI News Writer (COMPLETE)
- **Status:** All tasks (10.1-10.7) completed.
- **Outcome:** Basic API infrastructure created for article submission via JWT authentication.
    - Dependencies installed & configured (DRF, SimpleJWT).
    - `Article` model defined and migrated.
    - `ArticleSerializer` created (sets author automatically).
    - `ArticleCreateAPIView` implemented (requires JWT auth).
    - API URL `/news/api/articles/create/` defined and included.
- **Notes:** Addressed `django-ratelimit` import error by removing it, relying on DRF's built-in throttling.
