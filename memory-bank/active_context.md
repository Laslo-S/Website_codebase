## Detailed State

**Project Status:** Active Development

**Current Focus:** Reviewing and documenting recent frontend enhancements:
    - Refined Gallery: Dynamic width calculation using JS based on viewport size relative to configurable thresholds, achieving responsive aspect ratio changes.
    - Added Services Background: Implemented configurable Three.js wireframe sphere animation as a subtle background layer.
    - Improved Services Styling: Made SVG grid fainter, added configurable gradient fade-in, layered backgrounds correctly.
    - Fixed Lottie Elements: Restored footer icons and scroll indicator functionality (JS init, CSS animation, scroll behavior).
    - Resolved Configuration/Build Issues: Corrected Django STATIC_ROOT and template block inheritance problems.

**Next Step:** Await user direction for the next development task or phase. Consult @file:TASKS.mdc when instructed.

**Recent Milestones:**
- Completed dynamic gallery system overhaul.
- Completed services section background animation implementation.
- Completed Lottie element fixes and refinements.
- Completed Phase 16: Integrated dynamic data for homepage gallery (via new `SlideshowImage` model) and news section. Updated static links (Client Portal login).
- Completed Refactoring: Moved interactive background JS to `static/js/` and Hero showcase HTML to `templates/partials/`.
- Completed Phase 15: Styled all homepage sections (`home.html`) based on v0 design, including interactive background and reusable partials.
- Completed Phase 14: Translated base HTML structure (base.html, header/footer partials, homepage sections) from v0 source files. Integrated global CSS variables and base styles from v0 into Tailwind configuration (input.css, tailwind.config.js).
- Completed Phase 13: Added status fields, implemented comprehensive preview mode (admin toggle, frontend banner, content filtering), simplified client deliverable workflow, refined admin UI.
- Debugged and resolved issues with URL routing, model imports, middleware logic, template context, and CSS styling related to the preview system.
