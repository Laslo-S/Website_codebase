- Operationalized the NewsPost creation API for external use.

## Phase 12: Client Deliverables System (Completed)

- Refined User admin UI (collapsible sections, conditional fields, list display links).
- Simplified preview logic, removing client-specific preview trigger.
- Resolved various bugs throughout the implementation.

## Phase 14: Base Layout, Structure & Global Styles Translation (Completed)
- Translated base HTML structure (base.html, header/footer partials, homepage sections) from v0 source files (`page.txt`, `ClientLayout.txt`).
- Integrated global CSS variables and base styles from v0 `globals.txt` into Tailwind configuration (`input.css`, `tailwind.config.js`).
- Applied basic structural layout classes to header, footer, and homepage sections.
- Updated frontend layout rules.

## Phase 15: Component Styling & Static Visual Integration (Completed)
- Applied Tailwind CSS classes to style Hero, Services, Projects, Client Portal, News, and CTA sections in `home.html` based on v0 design.
- Created partials: `_service_card.html`, `_client_portal_card.html`, `_news_card.html`.
- Translated and integrated interactive grid background animation from v0 React component into vanilla JS for Hero section.
- Added placeholders for dynamic content (project images, news posts).
- Iteratively refined Hero section text, button layout, and background animation based on feedback.

## Refactoring (Post-Phase 15) (Completed)
- Moved interactive background JavaScript from `home.html` to `static/js/interactive-hero-background.js`.
- Moved Hero showcase elements (3 placeholders) from `home.html` into `templates/partials/_hero_showcase.html`.

## Phase 16: Dynamic Data Integration (Completed)
- Task 16.1 (Slideshow Refactor): Replaced homepage slideshow implementation. Removed `is_featured`/`slideshow_order` from `PublicPortfolioItem`. Created dedicated `slideshow` app with `SlideshowImage` model and admin. Updated `HomePageView` and template to use new model.
- Task 16.2 (Services): Marked N/A as content is static.
- Task 16.3 (News): Updated `home.html` news section to correctly loop through `latest_posts` context variable and use `_news_card.html` partial.
- Task 16.4 (CTA Banner): Marked N/A as content is static.
- Task 16.5 (Client Portal): Updated "Secure Login" button link to use `{% url 'accounts:login' %}`.
- Task 16.6 (Header/Footer): Marked N/A for now.

**[Date - e.g., 2024-04-09] Frontend Refinements & Fixes:**
*   **Homepage Gallery:** Overhauled gallery implementation. Replaced previous fixed-width/breakpoint approach with a JavaScript-driven dynamic width calculation. Slide width now interpolates between a minimum aspect ratio (controlled by `--gallery-aspect-ratio-variance`) and 16:9, based on the viewport width relative to `--gallery-min-aspect-threshold` and `--gallery-full-aspect-threshold`. Swiper (`slidesPerView: 'auto', `swiper.update()`) handles layout.
*   **Services Background Animation:** Implemented a new background effect for the "Our Services" section using Three.js (v0.160.0). Added a subtle, interactive wireframe sphere (`services-background.js`) layered behind content (`z-0` canvas). Configuration (colors, opacity, physics) managed via CSS variables.
*   **Services Background Styling:** Enhanced layering. Made existing SVG grid pattern fainter (`strokeWidth`). Added a configurable gradient fade-in from the top (`--services-grid-fade-height`, `--services-grid-fade-start-opacity`). Removed solid background from parent section, added light background (`bg-slate-50`) to ensure visibility of white sphere elements.
*   **Lottie Fixes:** Restored missing footer social icons by re-adding Lottie player script and initialization logic (`initializeLottieIcons`) to `base.html`. Corrected icon color from black to white using CSS `filter: invert() brightness()`. Restored missing scroll indicator animation by re-adding CSS keyframes (`@keyframes bounce-and-scale`) and associated CSS rules to `base.html`. Restored scroll-based hiding logic (`handleScrollIndicatorVisibility` and scroll listener) in `base.html` script. Centered scroll indicator reliably using `left-0 right-0 mx-auto`.
*   **Configuration & Build:** Resolved critical issues preventing script execution. Defined `STATIC_ROOT` in `config/settings.py` to enable `collectstatic`. Corrected template inheritance in `home.html` by adding `{{ block.super }}` to `{% block scripts %}`.
