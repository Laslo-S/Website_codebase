Current Focus: Homepage sections are styled and integrated with dynamic data (Gallery, News). Code refactored for JS and Hero Showcase.

Next Step: Consult TASKS.mdc for Phase 17 objectives.

Recent Milestones:
- Completed Phase 16: Integrated dynamic data for homepage gallery (via new `SlideshowImage` model) and news section. Updated static links (Client Portal login).
- Completed Refactoring: Moved interactive background JS to `static/js/` and Hero showcase HTML to `templates/partials/`.
- Completed Phase 15: Styled all homepage sections (`home.html`) based on v0 design, including interactive background and reusable partials.
- Completed Phase 14: Translated base HTML structure (base.html, header/footer partials, homepage sections) from v0 source files. Integrated global CSS variables and base styles from v0 into Tailwind configuration (input.css, tailwind.config.js).
- Completed Phase 13: Added status fields, implemented comprehensive preview mode (admin toggle, frontend banner, content filtering), simplified client deliverable workflow, refined admin UI.
- Debugged and resolved issues with URL routing, model imports, middleware logic, template context, and CSS styling related to the preview system.
