*   **Phase 1:** Foundation & Backend Setup (Django, SQLite, Env Vars, Initial Rules).
*   **Phase 2:** Foundational Frontend Layout (Base HTML, Static Files Config, Mobile-First Structure).

*   **Phase 7:** User Content Flow & Refinement (Implemented dynamic user content display on user pages. Enhanced User admin with inline projects. Refined template structure with partials (_header, _footer). Documented final structure and conventions in README and memory bank.)
*   **Phase 8:** Dynamic Content & Styling (Connected DB models to public list views. Implemented pagination. Refined Tailwind styling on base layout, cards, header/footer. Created pagination and Tailwind config partials/rules.)
*   **Phase 9:** News/Blog Implementation (Created `news` app, `NewsPost` model with status/slug logic. Configured admin with CKEditor 5. Implemented list/detail views and templates. Added latest news to homepage and header link. Removed author field. Added featured image support.)

### Phase 10: Implement Foundational API for External AI News Writer (Refactored in Phase 11)
- **Status:** Base models/serializers/views created, but model/API refactored in Phase 11.
- **Outcome:** Initial setup of DRF, SimpleJWT. Original `Article` model created (later deleted).

### Phase 11: Operationalize External NewsPost API (COMPLETE)
- **Status:** All tasks completed after refactoring to use `NewsPost`.
- **Outcome:**
    - API now uses `NewsPost` model instead of separate `Article` model.
    - `Article` model, serializer, admin removed. Stale permissions cleaned.
    - `ai_news_agent` user and `AI-Agents` group created.
    - Group permission `news | news post | Can add news post` assigned.
    - Custom `IsNewsAgent` permission implemented and applied.
    - JWT token endpoints (`/api/v1/accounts/token/` and `/refresh/`) added.
    - API endpoint `/news/api/news-posts/create/` tested successfully for creating `NewsPost` items (including image upload) using JWT auth and group permissions.
- **Notes:** Addressed various serializer validation issues (`author`, `slug`). Corrected group name (`AI-Agents`).
